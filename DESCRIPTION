Description: 
  This package manipulates the spreadsheet exported from pyCGM2.
  The spreadsheet gathers time-normalized joint variable ( kinematics or kinetics). 
  pyrCGM2 offers user-friendy R fonctions fro plotting gait panels or quantifies a difference
  between two or more variables with a metrics.
  I try to make things simple as possible with explicit R functions. 
  For those who want to start with, i recommand to check out the different vignettes 
  representing a concrete gait analysis scenario.
